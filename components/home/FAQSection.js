      answer:
        "We don't use generic models or push subscriptions. Throwback AI is tailored for historic, sentimental photos and built by people who care about family legacy.",

      question: "Is it really free to try?",

      question: "What happens to my photo after it's restored?",

        "Absolutely. Once restored, they're yours to print, gift, publish, or share.",
